## to start a new simulation, we need to update guppy on the 
## type of flow cell that was used to make the simulation data

## this means that the guppy server needs to be pointed to a 
## new config file. The new guppy config file to use is: 

"dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_fast.cfg"

## then the guppy server daemon will need to be restarted. 
## there is an example of how/where to do this in my scripts 
## (kind of a mess), or log into community.nanoporetech.com 
## and look at my comment at the end of this discussion:

## we also need to change the sequencing toml file (not the 
## just the readfish toml!). Do you remember where these are?
## since it is just a simulation, it is probably okay to 
## use the same file as before ("sequencing_MIN106_DNA.toml"). 

## in this file, change the "simulation" line to match your 
## new bulk fast5 file. Try to find and change the following 
## line:

## simulation= <name of your bulk-fast5 file, full (absolute) path)>

## you'll also need to make a minimap2 index of the new genome, 
## and point your readfish toml file to this mmi file, in the 
## same way as we used the human genome mmi file in the online
## examples. 

## plus there are the usual debugging steps we've already covered
## and probably several things I've forgotten...

## if everything gets up and running, try different adaptive 
## sequencing settings (accept all reads that align to host, 
## reject all reads that align to host, etc).
