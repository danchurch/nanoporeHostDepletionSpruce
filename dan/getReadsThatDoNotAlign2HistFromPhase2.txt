## how do we get the matches not included in our alignment?

## seqtk and sort/uniq might be useful

## let's pretend the names of all the reads in the alignment are here:
cut -f1-12 phase2hostDepletion_Align2Spruce.paf | head -n 20 > toy.paf

## to get just the names we use cut
cut toy.paf -f 1

## so we can sort these and get only the unique ones:
cut toy.paf -f 1 | sort | uniq > seqsThatAligned.txt

## now we need the names of the sequences in our fastq

## for this we would use sed, and tell it to print every 
## fourth line

sed -n '1~4p' toy.fastq 

## but this gives us a lot of extra information. We just want the name of the read

## cut to the rescue, again!

sed -n '1~4p' toy.fastq |
cut -f 1 -d " " 

## but notice there is still an "@" at the beginning? Use sed again to get rid of it:

sed -n '1~4p' toy.fastq |
cut -f 1 -d " " |
sed "s/^@//" > namesOfAllPhase2Reads.txt

## give it a sanity-check, make sure it looks like only read names are in there
## (with less or whatever)

## now, we want get reads that didn't align at all to the spruce genome
## this means we need to subtract the the aligned reads from the total reads

## we can do this like we did before with "sort | uniq" 
## can you build the command in BASH for this?
