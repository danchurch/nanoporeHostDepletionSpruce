## find your reads to be aligned..
## for today, we are using the raw nanopore reads from 
## phase2. 
## they will need to be concatenated, and the unblocked 
## reads will need to be removed, like yesterday
## then you should put them on your denbi computer 
## somewhere

## the lab computer can scp directly to denbi if you want to do
## this, let me know if you want to set this up and need help


## you have two large storage areas on denbi:

## ephemeral storage is here:
/mnt/ephem

## long term storage is here:
/vol/piceaNanopore

## feel free to make yourself working directories in both

## the full spruce genome is here on denbi:
ls -lh /vol/piceaNanopore/spruceGenome/Pabies-haploid_withOrganelles.fa

## make a fresh minimap2 index from this
## (do you have minimap2 installed somewhere on denbi?)
## (if not, make an environment and intall it!)
cd /vol/piceaNanopore/dan/chrisHostDepletionTrial/spruceRefGenome/

## once you have your reads in place, and a minimap index

reads=/path/to/your/reads
nohup minimap2 \
  -I100g \
  -t 20 \
  -x map-ont \
  --secondary=no \
  $sprucemmi $reads \
  1> phase2hostDepletion_Align2Spruce.paf \
  2> phase2hostDepletion_Align2Spruce.paf.log &

## can you understand these arguments, if you look at the manual for minimap2?
## as in: "man minimp2"

## let's look at this together when you have this paf file.
